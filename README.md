# SecurityJourney: Online Web Learning System
<h2>Prepared by Nurhanis Binti Abdul Razak and Nadirah Binti Ros Liza</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>SecurityJourney, is a web-based information security learning system developed for the IIUM community. The content is based on four main courses in Information Assurance and Security (IAS) specialization- Management of Information Security, Risk Management, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery, and Control and Audit of Information Systems. The platform employs with visual, kinesthetic, auditory, and read-or-write learning methods, to cater to various learning styles, with the aim of providing high-quality education for all within the IIUM community.</p>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<ul>
<li>Users, especially from IIUM community, struggle to obtain revision notes and resources due to overlap with other courses' topics on websites.</li>
<li>When users learn theoretically, the materials they find are a little difficult for them to comprehend.</li>
<li>Some websites lack of interactive features like quizzes that would test audiences’ understanding and help them absorb the content better.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Objective</h3>
<ul>
<li>Design and develop a working web application learning system for information security.</li> 
<li>Enhance users' understanding in information security through the features and functionality offered by the system.</li>
<li>Provide a user-friendly, interactive, and responsive learning system.</li>
<li>Encourage the IIUM community to learn about information security through various learning methods in a simple and comprehensible way.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Scope</h3>
<p>The project is to give the IIUM community access to a consolidated information technology security learning system, with a focus on Information Assurance and Security (IAS) specialized students from Kulliyyah of Information and Communication Technology (KICT). With the integration of materials onto a single platform, this approach seeks to streamline and accelerate information security education. Limitations to the project include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Technical limitations: Developers need to enhance their skills for optimal system effectiveness.</li>
<li>Creating engaging learning materials: Balancing enjoyment and relevance while adhering to course guidelines poses challenges.</li>
<li>Adaptability to changing technology and educational goals: Developing a scalable system capable of evolving with technological and educational changes is challenging. </li>
<li>Copyright issues: Careful assessment of copyright restrictions is necessary when obtaining lecture notes and materials for IAS specialist courses to maintain resource quality.</li> 
</ol>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>SecurityJourney was developed via rapid prototyping. This method is effective in gathering information, engaging users for feedback, and utilizing suggestions for improvement. It helps to avoid unnecessary resource allocation and ensures early evaluation of system concepts, user interfaces, and overall operation. Effective communication and constructive feedback are critical for ensuring that the end product satisfies user expectations. Moreover, rapid prototyping provides flexibility, allowing for continual modification based on user input while minimizing the waste of key development resources.</p>

<h3>Development Requirement</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Visual Studio Code is a development environment code editor designed to support debugging, task running, and version control for efficient development for SecurityJourney system.</li>
  <li>Laravel PHP and PHPMyAdmin: Laravel is the framework for developing the SecurityJourney system and PHPMyAdmin is to handle the administration of MySQL over the Web for this system.</li>
  <li>XAMPP was used to set up the local server for testing and deploying the SecurityJourney system.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>Implementing rapid prototyping in this project allowed developers to detect and rectify faults throughout the process efficiently. This development approach offers flexibility as it allows ongoing adjustments based on user requirements. Additionally, it facilitates rapid feedback for developers by minimizing the waste of valuable system development resources. Given that SecurityJourney is an educational platform, rapid prototyping aligns well with its iterative nature and user-oriented focus. The feedback gathered during beta testing enabled developers to address any concerns before moving on to user acceptability testing (UAT). User acceptance testing (UAT) was carried out after the finished system was ready for launch. The goal of UAT was to test all functionalities of the final product properly. The developers attempted to confirm that the system matched all planned criteria defined during prototyping before closing the project. For this SecurityJourney system, the testing is done through beta testing. This system had been tested by 4 users, two from non-IAS students, one IAS student and one staff. They were required to register account and access all features available. For the admin side, the developer monitored users’ activities from time to time to make sure no error occurred. Finally, all interfaces were evaluated for system reliability and performance purpose to ensure the system met the objective of the project. </p>
